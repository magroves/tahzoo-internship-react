# Tahzoo Internship Full-Stack Project

In this project, we used the MERN stack to make a very simple full-stack application as we explored using new technologies to make us adequate developers when we join client projects. The MERN stack includes Mongoose for database needs, Express for back-end development, React for front-end development, and Node for running it all. Our project consists of a database of Premier League clubs that we created through a cloud based solution through Mongodb. Prior to this project neither one of us had used React, Node, Express, etc and were brand new to this type of application. We followed along with this great tutorial for setting up the back-end portion of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc2pOPeQyOs&t=0s&ab_channel=EsterlingAccime. We used TailwindCSS for our CSS template throughout our site and a preview can be seen below. Big thanks to Noah Weingand for helping us throughout this entire process and for Tahzoo for giving us the time and resources to learn this material.
